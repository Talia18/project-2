![business](https://github.com/Talia18/react-app-project/assets/111443123/4e453fd9-4081-4a67-b434-1e1a1405b319)

## Description

The site provides a service for people who are looking for work with business owners. On the site you will find cards of business owners who are with them.

My motivation for building the site is to strengthen the relationship between employers and people so that they can create cooperation together to promote a common goal.

I built this site because when I was looking for businesses to work with it took me a very long time, and I thought of a solution that could solve my problem and could make it easier for other people.
