#### The site provides a service for people who are looking for work with business owners. On the site you will find cards of business owners who are with them.

#### My motivation for building the site is to strengthen the relationship between employers and people so that they can create cooperation together to promote a common goal.

#### I built this site because when I was looking for businesses to work with it took me a very long time, and I thought of a solution that could solve my problem and could make it easier for other people.
